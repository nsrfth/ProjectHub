# Changelog

All notable changes to TaskHub are documented in this file. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-22

First public release. Covers every model in the schema with an end-to-end
backend + frontend implementation and a green integration-test suite
(98 tests across 11 files, run on every push via GitHub Actions).

### Auth

- Email + password registration / login with **argon2id** password hashing.
- JWT access tokens (15 min default) + refresh tokens delivered as
  `httpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` cookies scoped to `/api/auth`.
- Refresh-token rotation; reusing a revoked token is rejected.
- Server-issued password reset (in non-prod the reset token is surfaced in the
  response body to avoid a hard email dependency).
- First-user-becomes-ADMIN promotion on first registration.
- Rate-limited write-side endpoints (env-configurable; defaults to 10/min/IP).

### Teams

- Team CRUD; slug uniqueness enforced.
- Membership with `MANAGER` / `MEMBER` roles.
- Invariant guarded by the service layer: a team must always have at least one
  MANAGER (the last MANAGER can be neither removed nor demoted).

### Projects

- Nested under teams (`/api/teams/:teamId/projects/...`) so `requireTeamRole`
  enforces tenancy via the URL.
- Owner-or-MANAGER edit/delete.
- Cross-tenant probes return 404 — never leak existence.

### Tasks

- CRUD plus a `doneAt` column for completion-date tracking.
- `doneAt` is auto-filled when status transitions to `DONE` if the user hasn't
  set one explicitly; auto-fill is intentionally _not_ logged as a separate
  activity event (it's a side-effect of `task.status_changed`).
- Status filter on list.
- Sparse position scheme (1000-step gaps per `(projectId, status)` column)
  ready for future drag-and-drop reorder.
- Assignee validation: the assignee must be a team member.

### Comments

- Threaded comment list per task, oldest first.
- Author-only edit. Author OR team MANAGER can delete.
- Every mutation wrapped in `prisma.$transaction` so the comment row and its
  activity row commit together.

### Activity log

- Single emit point (`logActivity`) writes rows transactionally alongside the
  triggering mutation.
- Diff-aware: only fields the user explicitly changed produce a
  `task.updated` event; no-op PATCHes emit nothing.
- Known actions: `task.created`, `task.updated`, `task.status_changed`,
  `comment.added`, `comment.edited`, `comment.deleted`.
- Bound to its task — deletions are deliberately not logged (Activity FK
  cascades from Task). A separate non-cascading audit table is future work.

### Notifications

- User-scoped (no team in the path); each query is implicitly filtered to the
  caller.
- Three fan-out triggers: `TASK_ASSIGNED` on assignment, `TASK_COMMENT` on
  comment, `TASK_STATUS` on status change. The actor is always excluded.
- `unread-count` endpoint feeds a bell badge in the top-right of every
  authenticated page; clicking opens a dropdown with the latest 20.

### Labels

- Team-scoped colored tags; name unique per team (409 on duplicate).
- Hex color (`#RRGGBB`) validated. SVG MIME deliberately omitted — see
  Attachments below.
- Attach is idempotent; deleting a label cascade-detaches from every task.
- Surfaced inline on the task response (`labels: [...]`) so kanban cards can
  render chips without an extra round trip. Chips auto-pick black or white
  text via BT.601 luminance.

### Subtasks

- Checklist children of a task (title + done flag + position).
- Surfaced inline on the task response.
- Cross-parent guard: subtaskId must belong to the taskId in the URL.

### Attachments

- Multipart upload via `@fastify/multipart` with `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` enforced
  as a streaming limit; oversize uploads stream up to the cap, then the
  partial file is unlinked and the request rejected.
- MIME allowlist (10 types: common image formats, PDF, plain text, markdown,
  CSV, JSON, ZIP). **SVG is explicitly excluded** because inline `<script>`
  in SVG runs in the same origin.
- User-supplied `filename` never touches the filesystem — server generates an
  opaque `storageKey` (`crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex')`) for the
  on-disk path. Defense-in-depth path-traversal guard verifies the resolved
  download path is rooted under `UPLOAD_DIR`.
- `Content-Type` on download pinned from the stored MIME type
  (Helmet's `nosniff` reinforces).
- Uploader OR team MANAGER can delete.

### Admin

- `/api/admin` endpoints gated by `requireGlobalRole('ADMIN')`.
- User role promote/demote with two hard guards: can't demote the last ADMIN;
  can't change your own role even when other admins exist.
- Force-delete a team — schema cascade tears down memberships, projects,
  tasks, subtasks, comments, activity, notifications, labels, attachments
  in one transaction.

### Shamsi (Persian/Jalali) calendar

- Storage and API transport stay UTC ISO 8601; only display is Shamsi.
- Helpers in `frontend/src/lib/shamsi.ts`: compact `formatShamsiDate`,
  longer-form `formatShamsiLong`, `formatShamsiDateTime`, and bridge
  utilities between `<input type="date">` and ISO.
- Applied on kanban cards, task detail, comments, activity feed.

### Operations

- Docker Compose deploys Postgres 16, Redis 7, Fastify backend, Vite-built
  SPA, and Caddy 2 as reverse proxy (auto-HTTPS for a real hostname).
- Baseline Prisma migration in version control plus one delta migration for
  `Task.doneAt`. Future schema changes follow the standard
  `prisma migrate dev` flow.
- GitHub Actions CI: backend job spins up Postgres as a service container,
  applies migrations, runs typecheck + vitest; frontend job runs
  typecheck + production bundle. Both gated on every push and PR.

### Security model

- Helmet headers + Caddy adds HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy.
- CORS is an explicit allowlist; `credentials: true` cannot pair with `*` by
  design.
- All input validated with Zod; Prisma's parameterized queries close the SQL
  injection door.
- Auth endpoints have per-route rate limiting controlled by env.
- Cross-tenant resource access returns 404 (not 403) so the existence of
  another team's data isn't leaked.

### Known limitations

- No within-column drag-and-drop reorder on the kanban yet (the
  `position` field and sparse-position scheme are ready for it).
- `TASK_DUE` notifications and `@mention` parsing not implemented; both need
  additional infrastructure (scheduled job runner; body parser).
- No user-deletion endpoint in admin — `Project.owner`, `Task.creator`, and
  `Comment.author` are RESTRICT relations in Prisma, so user delete needs a
  reassign-ownership flow or a schema migration first.
- Notification click-through routes to the dashboard, not the specific task;
  payloads carry `taskId` but not `projectId` yet.
